File Photo by Rune Hellestad/UPI | License Photo  Nov. 16 (UPI) -- Emma Stone joked that Jennifer Lawrence lost out on her Easy A role because she "sucks." The 29-year-old actress, who starred as Olive Penderghast in the 2010 movie, ribbed Lawrence for failing to land the part in a roundtable interview with the 27-year-old star for The Hollywood Reporter. Advertisement  Stone brought up Easy A after being asked if there is a line from a specific film that has stuck with her. She answered, "[Expletive] off, Quiznos," leading Lawrence to share she had auditioned for the movie.  "I auditioned for Easy A. I wanted it so bad," Lawrence confessed.  "Well, guess what?" Stone responded before joking, "You didn't get it. You didn't get it because you suck!"  Easy A helped skyrocket Stone to fame, while Lawrence would instead star in Winter's Bone, the X-Men reboot films and The Hunger Games movies. The pair said in the interview that they have discussed a future collaboration.  "I would love to. I keep trying to convince her," Stone said. "I have so many ideas."  "There is one idea that's floating around, but it's a secret," Lawrence confirmed.  Advertisement  Stone will next star in The Favourite with Joe Alwyn, while Lawrence is slated for Red Sparrow.

Question: Oh boy. Photo: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images  The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”  But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.Please tell me if this news is true or false.

Question: David Letterman, left, chats with George Clooney's dad, Nick, and University of Chicago student Hazim Avdal, right, for an episode of “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction" that premiered Friday on Netflix. (Joe Pugliese / Netflix)  University of Chicago computer science student Hazim Avdal was too busy with schoolwork to watch his interview with David Letterman when it premiered Friday morning. Avdal sat down with the veteran talk show host to explain how he left Iraq after the Islamic State targeted his hometown and received support from George and Amal Clooney to continue his studies in Chicago.  Avdal’s appearance on the new Netflix series “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction” was part of a wide-ranging interview Letterman conducted with George Clooney about his career, his marriage to Amal, their 8-month-old twins and their sponsorship of Avdal, who moved to Chicago in September.  Advertisement  “I’m hoping that through this Letterman show that (my classmates and friends) will be more aware of the things that happened back in Iraq,” Avdal told the Tribune.  Avdal, 23, grew up as part of the Yazidi religious minority in the Sinjar region of northern Iraq. He graduated high school in 2013 and was accepted to the University of Mosul but was unable to begin his studies because al-Qaeda violence against Yazidis made Mosul unsafe. In 2014, the Islamic State, or ISIS, began the Yazidi genocide.  Advertisement  Thousands of Yazidis were massacred or kidnapped. Women were turned into sex slaves, while children were separated from their families and forced to convert to Islam.  Avdal told the Tribune he was working about six hours from his hometown when the attacks began. He said his family escaped just minutes before ISIS arrived. They went to a refugee camp in Turkey. His mother now lives in Germany, while other relatives are still in Iraq. Avdal’s father died when he was a young boy.  Avdal ended up working in Iraq for Yazda, an organization devoted to supporting the Yazidi community in the aftermath of the genocide. A self-taught programmer, Avdal designed and programmed database management software that helped the organization manage its clients — hundreds of Yazidi women rescued from sexual enslavement.  It is through this organization that Avdal connected with Amal Clooney, an international human-rights lawyer who represents Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman who survived enslavement. Avdal said he met Clooney at a ceremony for Murad when she was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations in September 2016.  “I’ve had the privilege of representing a number of Yazidis who have been the victims of genocide perpetrated by ISIS over the last couple of years; that’s how I met Hazim,” Amal Clooney told Letterman on his show. “And when I met him, I remember being so struck by his courage but also just this amazing spirit and how he spoke about, even after everything he lost, he spoke about a desire for justice, not revenge.”  Avdal also met Matthew Barber, a University of Chicago doctoral student focused on Islamic thought and Syrian and Iraqi history. Barber, the former executive director for Yazda in Iraq, talked up the University of Chicago to Avdal while they worked together for a year. Barber, meanwhile, worked behind the scenes with George Clooney to try to get Avdal into the school.  Yazidi refugee Hazim Avdal, left, is pictured on the day in May 2017 he found out he was admitted to the University of Chicago. (Courtesy of Matthew Barber / Handout)  “I was really impressed with his character and his work ethic when I was there, but also his intelligence,” Barber told the Tribune. “Iraq has a standardized high school examination that’s given to all graduating seniors from high school. … The year that Hazim graduated from high school, he was the seventh-highest-scoring student in the whole country of Iraq.”  Avdal found out he was accepted to the University of Chicago in May 2017 during a visit to the admissions office. Barber said Avdal buried his face in his hands and couldn’t speak for several minutes.  Advertisement  Barber and one of George Clooney’s cousins helped move Avdal into his dorm in September before he began classes. During breaks and holidays, Avdal stays at Clooney’s home near the Oscar winner’s parents in their hometown of Augusta, Ky. Avdal gave Letterman a tour of the home for his show.  Avdal has mixed feelings about appearing on Letterman’s show since it will affect his anonymity. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published in September, George Clooney mentioned he and Amal took in a Yazidi refugee who was attending the University of Chicago, but Avdal was not named.  “I want people to know about what’s happening in other parts of the world, particularly in my experience, what happened in my part of the world,” Avdal told the Tribune. “On the other hand, I also want to live my life as a student here at the University of Chicago, just quiet and have my own privacy. So it’s like a trade-off. I will have to find a way to make a balance after (Letterman’s) show comes out.”  Avdal is too busy with his studies to think about potential fame. He plans to graduate with the class of 2021 and do “something meaningful” that would make a difference in Iraq. Barber said thousands of Yazidis whose homes and villages were destroyed by ISIS are still waiting for reconstruction support, while survivors of the genocide and enslavement are trying to put their lives back together.  Avdal is also still settling into his new life in Chicago.  “It’s a big city. I’m a small-town boy. This kind of environment is kind of new to me. The weather is crazy cold. Where I grew up it was warmer and more quiet,” Avdal said. “It was a little bit hard at the beginning, but now I love it.”  Advertisement  tswartz@tribpub.com  Twitter @tracyswartz  [ Documentary that follows Syrian family resettling in Chicago to air on WTTW ]  [ Chelsea Handler headlining Chicago fundraiser for Syrian refugee programs ]  [ John Stamos kept a piece of Chicago history from his 'ER' days ]Please tell me if this news is true or false.

Question: It appears that Justin Timberlake may be returning to the great Super Bowl stage for the highly coveted halftime show performance during the 2018 game.  According to Us Weekly, the 36-year-old singer and actor is "finalizing" a deal with the NFL to headline the big event in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Feb. 4. It would mark his return to the stage after the infamous "Nipplegate" incident in in 2004, when he performed with Janet Jackson for his song "Rock Your Body" and accidentally tore part of her costume off and exposed her nipple to viewers watching all over the country.  According to the report, if Timberlake signs the deal, he is said to be performing solo, and won't be bringing any of his former collaborators in as surprise guests.  Photo: Getty Images  Of course, Timberlake isn't the only performer whose name has been dropped as a performer for the 2018 show. Here are five other artists who have been reportedly tapped to headline the event:  Jay-Z  Photo: Getty Images  There were numerous reports that a Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake co-performance was being sought out for the show, with a chance that they would be collaborating together being "very high," according to BET. It's unclear if Jay-Z was also being considered as a solo act, but he was recently reported to have turned down the gig.  Britney Spears  Photo: Getty Images  Timberlake's long-time ex was also previously rumored as a consideration for the show earlier this year, marking a potential return after her last performance in 2001. However, a Pepsi executive who would help determine the performer shot down the rumor in July.  "I can tell you it's not Britney," Justin Toman said. "We'll reveal in due time."  Taylor Swift  Photo: Getty Images  The "Look What You Made Me Do" singer has been a favorite to headline the big game's halftime show for years, and doing so in 2018, fresh off the release of her highly-anticipated "Redemption" album, would make the game a great stage for her. However, she has reportedly already booked a different huge event in terms of halftime shows, so it seems more likely that she wouldn't be taking the Super Bowl gig this time around.  Adam Lambert and Queen  Photo: Getty Images  While not officially rumored to be contenders, the "American Idol" winner and the classic rock band, who are currently touring together, did win a Pop Crush fan poll when it came to who should perform at the NFL event. Compared to other performers on the poll, which included Christina Aguilera and Kylie Minogue, they handily won out with 38 percent of the votes.  BTS  Photo: Getty Images  The Korean pop band also hasn't been officially reported to be tapped for the big show, but a Billboard poll had them winning out with a considerably large percentage over several other contenders who were more mainstream. In that poll, 58 percent of fans wanted the group to perform at the show. The next closest contenders were Justin Bieber with 13 percent of the votes, Twenty One Pilots with nine percent, and Rihanna with four percent. The other contenders included Swift, Maroon 5, Kanye West, Miley Cyrus, The Weeknd, Carrie Underwood and Spears.Please tell me if this news is true or false. Only answer with "true" or "false".
Chain-of-thought: The news about Justin Timberlake potentially performing at the 2018 Super Bowl halftime show is true, as it was widely reported by various media outlets including Us Weekly. However, the status of other artists mentioned (Jay-Z, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Adam Lambert and Queen, BTS) as potential performers for the same event is not entirely accurate or has evolved over time. For instance, Jay-Z was reported to have turned down the gig, Britney Spears was officially ruled out by a Pepsi executive, and Taylor Swift was said to have already booked a different halftime show. Adam Lambert and Queen, as well as BTS, were not officially rumored but gained popularity in fan polls. Therefore, the answer to the question "Is this news true or false?" would be "true" for Justin Timberlake's potential performance and "false" for the other artists being officially tapped for the 2018 show, as of the time the information was reported.

Question: Students at Northwestern University open up on her antics as part of a hard-partying sorority  The actress Prince Harry looks set to pop the question to could not be more suited, say pals - because her student days were perfect training to keep up with the playboy prince.  While 36-year-old Meghan Markle may seem like the ideal princess-in-waiting, we can reveal she had a wild youth just like 32-year-old Harry.  Meghan’s days at Northwestern University in Chicago in the early 2000s have rarely been spoken about.  But a visit to her old stomping ground by the Sunday Mirror has revealed she was a typical party-loving student who allegedly used fake ID to go clubbing.  One of her favourite haunts is said to have been a bar that has since been shut down following a battle with authorities over underage drinking.  We also uncovered an article from the college news magazine in which Meghan herself joked she put on a stone after bingeing on Burger King in her Freshman year.  Interviewed by the magazine in 2014, after returning to the Northwestern campus for a Q&A session alongside fellow cast members of TV show Suits, she said: “It’s surreal because I haven’t been back since I graduated.  “And as I’m walking around I remember things like the schlep of getting to South Campus from up north.  “The 24-hour Burger King also ­definitely helped me put on the Freshman Fifteen.”  Image: Coleman-Rayner) Coleman-Rayner)  Meghan attended the university’s School of Communication at the same time as fun-loving Prince Harry was getting into trouble for heavy drinking.  In his late teens, the young prince was making headlines for his wild nights out in Gloucestershire pubs around Highgrove – Prince Charles’s country home.  One pub in particular, the Rattlebone Inn, which has since changed hands, was infamous for its boozy lock-ins.  Prince Harry even set up a nightclub for his posh friends in the basement of Highgrove, calling it Club H.  And while the prince partied with his exclusive group of pals, Meghan was at college mixing with members of her own posh pack.  Hers was an all-female society, called the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, with a reputation for hard partying and social climbing.  Current KKG member Melania Hidalgo told the Sunday Mirror that Meghan had been a popular member of the student body.  Image: Coleman-Rayner) Coleman-Rayner)  She said: “We’re intelligent hot messes. The thing we all have in common is that we’re all very driven, ambitious and passionate.  “Meghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.  “She was in charge of bringing in new girls – you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.  “I lived in the house for a year and it’s a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you’d mix with.  Image: Coleman-Rayner) Coleman-Rayner)  “All of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies… you develop very strong friendships.”  Meghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.  Former pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then – and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now  But she still found time to let her hair down in the Windy City. One former student claimed: “Meghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.  “You can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago – it’s a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.  Image: GC) GC)  “She seems like the perfect modern princess now, but she lived university life like most teenagers and was really popular on campus. Everyone talks about her going here.” The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence – after 36 years as a students’ favourite – following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.  It is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.  “It was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,” general manager Chris Nora said. “It doesn’t surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.  Image: WireImage) WireImage)  Door staff used to joke when girls finally handed over a real one, saying, ‘It’s about time!’”  Already an accepted part of the family, Meghan is in the UK this week to give Prince Harry much-needed support on the 20th anniversary of mum Diana’s death . She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William’s wife Kate and Harry’s nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.  Our trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan’s birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.  Rachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.  And photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned “Rachel Markle” – and another captioned “Meghan Markle”.  The find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.  And as speculation grows that the world’s most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe.Please tell me if this news is true or false.

Question: Nicole wants her husband Keith to join her in drama Big Little Lies (Picture: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)  Nicole Kidman has revealed that she wants her country crooner hubby Keith Urban to appear in the new series of Big Little Lies.  The 50-year-old Australian actress – who won a Golden Globe this year for her role as Celeste Wright in the smash hit HBO series – is turning on the charm to try and convince Keith, 50, to join her on screen.  However, as the couple spoke to Entertainment Tonight at the American Country Music Awards, it appears that the You’ll Think of Me singer isn’t so keen on moving over from the music studio to the movie set.  He told the website: ‘No. I’ll go on the set. I wouldn’t go on camera.’  Nicole scooped a number of awards – including a Golden Globe – for her role in the show (Picture: Paul Drinkwater/NBC via AP)  Nicole – who has been married to Keith since 2006 – couldn’t help but try and twist is arm and said: ‘He might do a cameo, wouldn’t you? … Never?’  ‘I love being on set where Nic is,’ he added. ‘[But] I’d rather be in the studio.’  With filming commencing on series two, Nicole couldn’t help but tease on what was to come from the gripping drama – including a little more info on the new character, played by Meryl Streep.  Speaking highly of the screen icon and what they have in store for the character, she said: ‘She’s got a fantastic character.  Nicole is returning with Reese Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley for Big Little Lies series two (Picture: HBO)  ‘It’s also grounded and it’s based in something very, very real, and we hope we bring you the [best] second season and it delivers. We’re working hard.’  The 68-year-old triple-Oscar-winning actress plays Mary Louise Wright in the show, mother of Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgard), Celeste’s deceased husband.  With the new castmate already shooting her scenes, Keith revealed that he has already stopped by the set to see her in action.  He said: ‘I love that she’s joined this crazy cast and this incredible ‘Big Little Lies’. I’ve seen little bits and pieces of it already and it’s amazing.’  Meryl will be joining the returning cast from last series, which includes Hollywood heavyweights Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley and Reese Witherspoon.  However, fans will have a long wait for the show to return – as HBO president Casey Bloys revealed that the show ‘definitely won’t air in 2018’.  Got a showbiz story?

Question: Camille Grammer has been diagnosed with cancer again.  The 49-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star spoke to PEOPLE exclusively on Thursday after revealing on Instagram she had received a Squamous Cell Carcinoma diagnosis and was recovering from surgery, having “those pesky cancer cells” removed.  It’s the second time the former dancer and model has battled cancer. In 2013, she was diagnosed with Stage 2 Endometrial Cancer and underwent a radical hysterectomy. She is currently in remission and has dedicated the past few years to spreading awareness about the below-the-belt cancers as a spokesperson for the Foundation for Women’s Cancer.  Like her Endometrial Cancer, Grammer’s Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) was found below the belt as well.  “Cancer really stinks,” Grammer told PEOPLE. “It’s unfortunate it runs in my family. I was diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome 15 years ago, so I have a genetic disposition to cancer. My mom had it also and her mom and unfortunately, these cancers seem to come along with the territory.”  “Early detection is key,” Grammer added, explaining that SCC can show up anywhere from the skin to the lung to your throat. “Many people, if something shows up like this, they’ll ignore it. They’ll think, ‘Oh it’s a mole, it’s a pimple, it’s a rash, it’s an ingrown hair from shaving.’ … This isn’t an aggressive cancer, but if it goes undetected, it could spread and metastasize to the lymph nodes and other organs close to the area. I’m lucky we found it early.”  Tommy Garcia/Bravo  While she admitted the location of her latest scare was “a little embarrassing to talk about,” Grammer made it clear she wanted to “lift the vail of shame” from below-the-belt cancers.  “It’s so important for women to go for check-ups,” she explained. “We can’t ignore these symptoms. We can’t ignore signals that our bodies are giving us when something is wrong. I’m a spokesperson, and advocate of awareness. So when anything comes up on our bodies — if it’s skin cancer or a bump or something we’re not certain of — we need to see our doctors. Go in, make an appointment, see our physicians, and don’t ignore these symptoms. When they present, don’t sweep them under the rug like so many of us do.”  RELATED VIDEO: Tamra Judge Delays Bodybuilding Competition After Discovering More Skin Cancer: ‘Get Your Skin Checked’  Squamous Cell Carcinoma, or SCC, is the second most common from of skin cancer, the Skin Cancer Foundation reports — and it is usually caused by cumulative ultraviolet exposure over the course of a lifetime. SCCs often appear as scaly red patches or elevated growths. More than 1 million cases of squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and (depending on different estimates) as many as 8,800 people die from the disease.  “I don’t know how exactly I got it, but listen — I used to go to tanning beds. As a teenager, those were so popular,” Grammer said, clarifying that she’ll have to wait about a week for pathology reports to come back to learn whether the SCC falls under the Lynch Syndrome umbrella,. “I’m not saying that’s the cause, I don’t know what the cause is. Some people think it’s from the HPV, but my pap-smear came up negative for HPV. Again, there’s no clear certain reason why this showed up in this case. But it’s better to get checked.”  On Thursday morning, Grammer shared a photo of herself at Cedars-Sinai hospital smiling next to her “amazing” surgeon Dr. Beth Karlan. “My cancer was removed and I’m resting at home,” she wrote. “Ladies listen to your bodies. If something doesn’t seem right go for a checkup. Don’t put it off. Annual check ups are important.”  Camille Grammer  While she waits two weeks to heal and resume physical activity, Grammer will have a strong place of support by her side: fiancé David C. Meyer — whom she has been dating for more than a year after meeting him in Malibu, where Meyer lives and works as a lawyer (He popped the question back in October).  Turns out, Meyer too recently had an SCC removed from his temple. “We were both laughing about this,” Grammer told PEOPLE. “With sun exposure, be careful. Protect yourself from the sun and get checkups!”  This will be the second marriage for both. Grammer (née Camille Donatacci) wed Frasier actor Kelsey Grammer in August 1997; their divorce was finalized in February 2011. The Grammers share two children: daughter Mason, 16, and son Jude, 13.  Grammer is also returning to RHOBH on Tuesday as a friend of the Housewives for the season 8 premiere, something she said she’s excited about because she gets to use the platform to help education more women about fighting cancer.  “Being a spokesperson for cancer awareness has been a passion of mine,” Grammer said. “It helps me in my recovery but also helps others. I’m very proud to be a part of this movement.”Please tell me if this news is true or false. Only answer with "true" or "false".

Question: Now that the Barbadian beauty Rihanna has turned 30, she has created a list of goals she wants to accomplish — and one goal concerns troubled singer Chris Brown.  In late February, the sexy songstress celebrated her birthday with a celebrity-filled bash in New York city with her family posted up strong.  Legendary singer Toni Braxton performed and RiRi’s billionaire boyfriend, Hassan Jameel, was said to be all over her the entire evening.  A source close to the “Rude Boy” singer spoke to Hollywood Life and said that after the big day, Rihanna wrote down a list of all the things she hopes to accomplish in the next few years.  Rihanna would love to get married, start a family, and make peace with Brown. The pair split after Brown assaulted Rihanna in early 2009. And while they briefly reunited, they were never able to rekindle that old love they had for whatever reason.  An insider told Hollywood Life: “Rihanna made a long list of goals after turning 30 this month. At the top of her list is getting finally married and starting a family. Dropping a new album, go on tour and being more creative in all avenues of her life. What also made a list was to make peace with some things in her past, including her history with Chris Brown.”  The person added: “Rihanna is madly in love with Hassan, and she is starting to plan for a future with him. This is the first guy since Chris that’s made her feel this way like she wants to settle down. She and Hassan mostly meet up in Europe; it is a good midway point for them. But now she is talking about making it her full-time base so she can have even more time with him.”  According to the family friend, the couple is not in a rush to get married or start a family.  The pal claimed: “They are serious, and now that Rihanna has hit the big 3-0 she is thinking about stuff like marriage and family a lot more. She always thought she would have several children by this age, so that is on her mind now too. She and Hassan are not rushing into anything, but that is where her head is going. It seems like she has met her Prince Charming.”Please tell me if this news is true or false. Only answer with "true" or "false".

False

Question: When the first season of Big Little Lies ended in the spring of 2017, fans of the buzzy miniseries figured that was that. After all, the debut season was marketed as a one-off miniseries, and it had adapted the entirety of the Liane Moriarty novel on which is was based. But months later, HBO surprised us all by revealing the show would get a second season. While we are still waiting for this new season to premiere, now fans are left with another pressing question: how much longer will the show go on? Will Big Little Lies Season 3 happen or is Season 2 where we will have to say goodbye to Monterey? Nicole Kidman talked about the future of the series in a recent interview, and it does not sound like fans should hold out much hope for more new seasons.  The biggest hurdle to keeping Big Little Lies going after its upcoming second season, it sounds like, is the hectic schedules of the cast. The ensemble drama boasts one of the most star-studded casts on television, and all of its stars are still putting out multiple blockbuster or critically acclaimed movies each year alongside their new TV jobs. The cast includes Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, and Zoë Kravitz, among others, and Season 2 will see none other than Meryl Streep joining the series as well.  With all of those huge names, it is not easy to block out time for production on Big Little Lies, and unfortunately, that might make Season 2 the last season of the show. In a new profile with Variety, Nicole Kidman said that although she and her costars would love to make a third season, she thinks that getting everyone back together could be difficult:  I think it would be hard to get the whole group together. But we would love to do it.  HBO  Another reason that Big Little Lies may not continue for much longer is the fact that it was only originally intended to run for one season. After fully telling the story of Liane Moriarty's Big Little Lies novel in Season 1, Moriarty penned a brand new continuation to her book once HBO announced it was picking up a second season.  The plot for the upcoming season is a big mystery for fans, but we do know it will most likely center on the group of women trying to keep quiet about the murder of Celeste Wright's abusive husband, Perry. Season 1 ended with Bonnie Carlson pushing Perry down a flight of stairs to his death, and the group of moms agreeing to keep the murder a secret to protect Bonnie. Although they seemed to manage to get the police off their scent, Meryl Streep will be playing Perry's mother, Mary Louise Wright, in Season 2, and her arrival in Monterey is sure to complicate matters.  A bigger mystery still is when Season 2 of Big Little Lies will finally premiere. The new season filmed throughout this past summer, and is set to premiere sometime in 2019.Please tell me if this news is true or false. Only answer with "true" or "false".

Question: If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: “There’s nothing wrong with making a mistake, what’s wrong is not making the effort to make it right,” and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, “It’s all in God’s hands always,” along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, “That was aimed directly at Alex.”  Hollywood’s hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he’s still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months — including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, “someone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that’s what made Jennifer lose it,” the insider tells In Touch. “Of course, he said it wasn’t physical, and maybe it wasn’t, but in Jennifer’s book, that’s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex’s actions have jeopardized everything.”  The damage runs deep. Jennifer, who’s endured three failed marriages, “was heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,” says the insider. “Even though they didn’t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex’s antics.”  She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. “A week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,” she claimed. “He never even mentioned her.” Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer “would be an idiot to believe he’d be faithful,” she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. “I don’t think he’s sexually attracted to her,” she dished. “In bed… he’s probably picturing me.”  Jennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she’s not sure what to believe. “Jennifer’s still on the fence,” says the insider. “She can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she’ll fight for it.”Please tell me if this news is true or false. Only answer with "true" or "false".

Question: I’ll admit, I’ve always been one of the many people that slags off this entire family – who are known to be famous for pretty much nothing.  However, the reality TV sucker in me has been intrigued over the years and Aaron’s mum has been watching it from start to finish on E! So I decided I should spend my week off work wisely (because I can’t drive and do the stuff I used to) and binge watch the lot from start to finish – 2007 to 2017.  I’ve bullet pointed the main points that contradicted what I thought I knew below and thought it might open the eyes of some other people too (unless you don’t care, because that’s okay lol);  Robert Kardashian was a music agent and not just a lawyer – I’m assuming this is where the name and money started rolling in from, but I’d always believed he was just a famous lawyer because of the OJ Simpson case  Bruce Jenner was a gold-winning Olympian and he made a lot of money through motivational speaking – I didn’t have a clue!  The series started the year that Kim’s world famous sex tape with Ray J was released to the world – I’m with a lot of theorists in that this was a PR stunt to get their name in the media  They’re a lot more charitable than the media makes out – yeah, they’re extremely spoiled and materialistic most of the time, but they’ve done a lot for those less fortunate than them  I’m into season 7 at the moment, so there’s a lot more surgery, divorces, sex changes and tabloid scandals to come – but I’m hooked!  Although they have more money than sense at times, I can’t help but see at times they’re just a normal family that rips the shit out of each other, playfights and argues just like my own!  I still find it difficult to comprehend that they’re famous for … well not a lot really, but do admire how they’ve used their platform to grow their own empires.  Although Kim takes the limelight the majority of the time, each family member has their quirks which makes them amusing to watch. I find Scott Disick hilarious, Kourtney’s snap back comments always make me chuckle and Khloe’s bluntness refreshing. I think the most genuinely famous member of the family is Kendall; she hasn’t used the show to explode her career (although I’m sure it’s helped!) and has bagged herself an amazing modelling career which you can see growing throughout the years of the show.  Love em or hate em, the Kardashians will be here for the long run (10 years of Keeping up with the Kardashians this year people!) and I’ll continue keeping my eyes glued to my screen!

Question: It’s an object lesson to us all. No matter how many partners you share or steal, how many backing dancers you tempt away, how much astonishingly unsubtle shade you throw online… there will always be friendship in the end.  That’s assuming, anyway, that the Katy Perry-Taylor Swift feud, which now dates back almost a decade, is truly over – and that détente was accomplished with only a (literal) olive branch, a plate of baked goods, and now a hug at the climax of Swift's new video for You Need To Calm Down.  Who needs Game of Thrones? Here’s a complete timeline – and please, let it be complete – of how two queens of the pop world began, maintained and resolved an unspeakably petty, but quite elaborate, dispute.  Strap in.  July 2009: Taylor Swift shares the love  We begin in 2009, when Swift was on the rise as a pop star, but was still recognised as a country singer. Kanye West’s pro-Beyoncé stage invasion at the MTV VMAs, which would still be a live wire for Swift in 2016 – sit tight, we’ll get there – was several months away.  Perry, meanwhile, was fresh off a tour backed by her breakthrough hit I Kissed a Girl, and racking up international accolades. (The MTV VMAs would be eventful for her, too: she met her husband-to-be Russell Brand at the ceremony.)Please tell me if this news is true or false. Only answer with "true" or "false".

Question: Keith Urban's introduction of Carrie Underwood on Wednesday night (Oct. 17) wasn't just about her long list of achievements in country music. It was just about her. He listed her virtues as a wife, a mother, a songwriter, a producer, an entertainer, a humanitarian, a culture shifter, and one of the greatest vocalists we've ever known.  (I think that was when she started to get a little choked up.)  But Urban also took the time to explain why he was the one lucky enough to be presenting her with the CMT Artist of the Year honor. "Our friendship really began way back in 2008, when we joined forces and hit the road together. And each night we would sing 'Stop Draggin' My Heart Around.' And it was then that I witnessed not only the power of her voice," Urban said, "but the emotion she brings to every performance.  "She simply makes you feel when she sings."  And apparently, Underwood simply makes you feel when she accepts important awards, too.  Her heartfelt acceptance speech wasn't so much about her as it was about the other honorees, the other women behind the scenes in the music industry, and other girls who might have the same dreams she had when she was a young country music fan and hopeful.  "We need more things like this. I definitely want to say to all the incredible, amazing, talented women who have been on this stage tonight: You are not here because you are women. You are here because you are dang good. And it is an honor to get to share tonight with you," Underwood said.  "Thank you to women who are in this industry: the managers, the executives, the hair and makeup (people), the wardrobe (people), the songwriters, the musicians, thank you. Whether or not you know it, you are the backbone of this music. And it is up to all of us to keep opening those doors.  "I want to see little girls at home seeing us on stage being like, 'I want to do that.' And I want them to know that that's possible," she said.Please tell me if this news is true or false.

Question: Steven Spielberg at the Warner Bros. Pictures world premiere of 'Ready Player One' in Hollywood, California. Credit: Photo by Michael Tran/FilmMagic  Welcome to Ad Age's Wake-Up Call, our daily roundup of advertising, marketing, media and digital news. What people are talking about today: Carl's Jr. tweeted that it's changing the name of its charbroiled sliders to "SpielBurgers," in tribute to "Ready Player One" director Steven Spielberg. It added: "@StevenSpielberg hasn't signed off yet, but we're pretty sure he'll be down with it."  But Spielberg says he's not OK with it. And he made a selfie video to explain that the burgers are "pretty good, but … I'm passing. Cease and desist. You can't do it. Sorry guys." The supposed food feud is getting a lot of press, though this all smells a lot like a marketing stunt. Carl's Jr. has a licensing agreement on "Ready Player One," as USA Today has pointed out. Eater and the A.V. Club argue that the spat is fake. Though even if that's the case, the A.V. Club writes, "Carl's Jr. did manage to get Steven Spielberg to do a little plug for its food. Doesn't he have better things to do?"  Best dad joke-esque tweet about all this: "Guess 'Taters of the Lost Ark' are out of the question then?"  'Sometimes, lighter is better'  Ad Age's E.J. Schultz looks at the back story on that Heineken campaign everyone's talking about, the one with an ad that Chance the Rapper branded "terribly racist," where the tagline is "Sometimes, lighter is better." The campaign from Publicis ran in Europe as far back as last summer "without any noticeable backlash," as Schultz writes. But markets react differently, and as Schultz adds, "The larger lesson might be the inherent danger when brands try to import work into the U.S. from abroad." Heineken's U.S. devision has pulled the ads.  NBCU tackles Facebook  NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke opened the company's fourth annual Innovation Day berating Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal: "They have a very serious problem." At the same time, as Ad Age's Jeanine Poggi says, Burke praised Snapchat (a company NBCU invested in during its initial public offering.) Thought leaders from Netflix, Google and IBM spoke at the event. Poggi emails a few more details: John Swift, CEO and president of North America investment at Omnicom Media Group, predicted that within the next three years we'll see a completely addressable national TV landscape. Another big prediction: By 2020, 50 percent of all searches will happen through voice, said Katie McMahon, VP and general manager of SoundHound Inc.  Also: NBC Universal has parted ways with its head of affiliate marketing, Scot Chastain, following an internal investigation, Poggi writes. The company declined to provide details.  Reviving "Roseanne"  The "Roseanne" reboot debuted on ABC, with the title character having become a Trump supporter since her last TV appearance in 1997. Star Roseanne Barr tells The New York Times that ABC didn't give her any pushback about that decision, though "everybody else in the world" did. Showrunner Bruce Helford tells The Hollywood Reporter: "We're tackling some stuff that most comedies wouldn't go anywhere near but we have a legacy to be that show and I think we're allowed." One other important thing to know: John Goodman's character was killed off in the 1990s, but just kidding! He's actually fine.  'No one out pizzas the Hut'  Pizza Hut is ending its relationship with Droga5, though they'll continue working together through June. As Ad Age's E.J. Schultz writes, Pizza Hut is launching a search for a new agency just as it's taking over from Papa John's as NFL sponsor. It will continue to use the Droga5-created tagline, "No one out pizzas the Hut" (though Domino's recently surpassed Pizza Hut in global sales.) For Droga5, it's another setback: A month ago, it laid off 5 percent of staff in New York across all departments, or about 40 people, as Schultz writes.  Just briefly:  Not there yet: The Association of National Advertisers tallied its members and found that "only 13 percent of the top jobs are held by people of color, including 5 percent Asian, 5 percent Hispanic/Latin and 3 percent black," E.J. Schultz writes.  He'll speak: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg "has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network's handling of customer data," The New York Times reports.  GIFs: Google just bought Tenor, a popular GIF platform with more users than Twitter, George Slefo writes in Ad Age.  Breitbart News: The right-wing site is getting into the live events business, The New York Times reports. The report notes that Breitbart's upcoming panel in Louisiana about privacy and tech "will be live-streamed – on Facebook."  Number of the day: $4 billion. H&M; has accumulated over $4 billion in unsold clothes, Bloomberg News reports.  Creativity pick of the day: Will Ferrell and Joel McHale ponder the meaning of contemporary art in a video promoting The Hammer Museum at UCLA's new exhibition, "Stories of Almost Everyone." And yes, the video is funny – and it seems surprisingly willing to acknowledge that contemporary art can be confusing.

Question: Ariana Grande has responded to claims that Rihanna was laughing at her during her performance at last week's iHeartRadio Music Awards.  Rihanna was seen laughing when the camera cut to her table at the Los Angeles ceremony on May 1, but Grande said that the 'Diamonds' singer was "just being playful".  Appearing on Australia's The Bump Show, the DJ told Grande: "[Rihanna] wasn't laughing at you, she was laughing at something your best friend said."

Grande explained: "I didn't see her laughing at me, but when I watched it afterwards it looked like she was just shocked because I was doing something different.  https://vine.co/v/MrvMeZtAFq3/embed/simple  "Afterwards she was so kind to me, she was like, 'Lil' mama keep doing what you're doing because it's working.'"  The 'Problem' singer said that she "thought it was funny that people tried to make such a commotion out of it".  "She was just being playful and supportive.
